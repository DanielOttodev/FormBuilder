Action Plan

1. Come up with a template / schema that will read JSON data and render HTML / React Components
- Start with a basic contact form ; Two input fields an image and a submit button
 
     Try different designs i.e input fields in separate rows, input fields in same row 2 columns 
- Validators , specific input types (password, email etc )

2. Create a 'toolbox' panel of form fields which will be later used to drag and drop onto the work area

From ChatGPT

1. Define the form structure: Determine the structure of the form you want to build. This includes the number of fields, the type of each field, and any validation rules that need to be applied.
2. Create the form builder interface: Design a user interface for the form builder that allows users to select different types of form fields and drag them onto the canvas.
3. Implement the drag-and-drop functionality: Use JavaScript to enable users to drag form fields from a sidebar and drop them onto the form builder canvas.
4. Store form data: Create a data structure to store the form data as users build the form. This could be an array, object, or another data structure of your choice.
5. Render the form: Use JavaScript to render the form as users build it, so they can see how the form will look to end-users.
6. Implement form validation: Write validation functions in JavaScript to ensure that user input meets the specified requirements.
7. Save and export the form: Implement functionality that allows users to save the form they have built and export it in a format that can be used on a website or shared with others.

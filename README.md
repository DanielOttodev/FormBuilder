Action Plan

1. Come up with a template / schema that will read JSON data and render HTML / React Components
- Start with a basic contact form ; Two input fields an image and a submit button
 
     Try different designs i.e input fields in separate rows, input fields in same row 2 columns 
- Validators , specific input types (password, email etc )

2. Create a 'toolbox' panel of form fields which will be later used to drag and drop onto the work area
